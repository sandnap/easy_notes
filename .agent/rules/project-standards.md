# Project Standards & Architectural Manifesto

Always refer to and follow the core instructions defined in the root manifesto: [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md).

You must read and adhere to the guidelines in that file for:
- **Architecture**: Service objects, Query objects, and Rails 8 conventions.
- **Tech Stack**: Hotwire, Tailwind CSS 4, and SQLite.
- **Code Style**: Ruby endless methods, query attributes, and Hotwire patterns.
- **Standards**: Linting requirements and database conventions.

Before starting any task, verify that your proposed implementation aligns with the standards set in AGENTS.md.
